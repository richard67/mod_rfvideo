# Richard Fath's Video Player Module for Joomla 4.
This is my video player module for Joomla 4.

I use it for replacing my inline scripted video players of my private Jooomla 3.10 website as part of preparing my site for upgrading to Jooomla 4, which is still work in progress.

There is already an installable package available for download, see the releases, and there is an update site for updates.

So feel free to use it.

But there is no documentation yet, and currently I won't be able to provide any support, so you would have to explore on your own how it works.

This might change when I find the time.
