# Richard Fath's Video Player Module for Joomla 4.
This is my video player module for Joomla 4.

I use it for replacing my inline scripted video players of my private Jooomla 3.10 website as part of preparing my site for upgrading to Jooomla 4, which is still work in progress.

The video itself is a standard HTML5 video element using either the `src` attribute or `source` elements.

What my player provides in addition is a playlist which can be used to navigate to sections of the video, display of loading or seeking status and the possibility switch between different groups of video sources typically for choosing different video qualities.

For each of these source groups it is possible to specify multiple video sources to support different video formats.

All parameters are defined in the module's settings, which provide also inline help texts.

There is already an installable package available for download, see the releases, and there is an update site for updates.

So feel free to use it.

But there is no documentation yet, and currently I won't be able to provide any support, so you would have to explore on your own how it works.

This might change when I find the time.
